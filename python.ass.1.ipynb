    "String:- In programming, a string is a sequence of characters, such as letters, numbers, or symbols, enclosed within quotation marks. Strings are used to represent and manipulate textual data. For example, \"Hello, World!\" is a string. Strings are typically used to store and manipulate text-based information like names, addresses, messages, etc. They can be assigned to variables for storage and retrieval.\n",

Variables are essential for storing and referencing values in a program. They have a name that can be used to refer to the stored value. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and more. Unlike strings, variables can store different values over time, and their values can be changed during the program's execution.\n",

It can be as simple as a single literal or variable, or it can be complex with multiple operators and operands.
